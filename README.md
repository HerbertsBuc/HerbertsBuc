A web scrapping application to scrape real estate data from the advertisment site ss.com and store the infromation in a CSV file. Created in Python using the BeautifulSoup library. The main challenge was that the site ss.com does not have standard HTML structure with divisions and classes for easy web scraping and required detailed pattern seeking in id numbers.

Scooter Rental application in C#. Managing many layers of classes and interfaces (archives, calculations, scooter service, scooter rental). Created with a TDD approach.

Flight Planner App - created a web application with C#, HTTP, Web API, TypeScript. The goal of the project was to create an application which can store flights between different airports and allows users to search them.
